#
# El Toro is an agressive scalping strategy that works in all market conditions.
# The Buy strategy makes use of the DEFAULT_buy_min_change_percentage to
# look for pairs that have lost 5% in the last 24 hours. It then looks for a
# buy signal within the last hour using an EMACROSS of 8/13. It then looks
# for an opportunity to buy a small dip in the price using a negative EMAGAIN
# pick pairs at the bottom of their trade cycle. It uses RSI to confirm we
# are at the bottom of the trade cycle to ensure we buy the dip. Finally it
# trails the price to ensure we get the best buy.
# It also employs the take profit
# DEFAULT_take_profit_percentage settings to sell if we are at 2% profit
# or better but havent sold in over 10 minutes (2 candles) allowing for a half
# a percent threshold. If we exceed that threshold the 10 minute countdown resets.
#
# This strategy works best in a Bull market, but will work in a bear or sideways
# market just much slower as volatility will be low in those markets.
#
#                            RUN WITH THE BULLS
